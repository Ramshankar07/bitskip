# BitSkip: BitNet with Learnable Early Exit and Routing

A PyTorch implementation of BitNet with advanced early exit mechanisms, learnable routing decisions, and joint optimization of quantization and routing losses.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Learnable Gating Network for Early Exit**
- **Architecture**: `Gate_l(x) = σ(Linear(ReLU(Linear(LayerNorm(x)))))`
- **Input**: Layer output activation `h_l`
- **Output**: Scalar probability `p_exit ∈ [0, 1]`
- **Training**: Straight-through estimator for differentiable Bernoulli sampling
- **Inference**: Threshold-based decision (`p_exit > 0.5`)

### 2. **Joint Loss Optimization**
- **Task Loss**: Standard cross-entropy loss for language modeling
- **Quantization Loss**: MSE between original and quantized weights
- **Routing Loss**: Target cost loss encouraging efficient early exit
- **Early Exit Loss**: Additional supervision for early exit mechanisms

### 3. **BitNet Architecture**
- **BitLinear Layers**: Ternary weight quantization (-1, 0, 1)
- **H-BitLinear Layers**: Hadamard transform + LayerNorm + quantization
- **Squared ReLU Activation**: `f(x) = ReLU(x)²`
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Memory-efficient training

## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Routing Module

```python
class RoutingModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size: int, dropout: float = 0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)
        self.gate_mlp = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size // 4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(dropout),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size // 4, 1),
        )
    
    def forward(self, hidden_states, training=True):
        x = self.layer_norm(hidden_states)
        p_exit_logits = self.gate_mlp(x)
        p_exit = torch.sigmoid(p_exit_logits)
        
        if training:
            z_exit = self._straight_through_sampling(p_exit)
        else:
            z_exit = (p_exit > 0.5).float()
        
        return p_exit, z_exit
```

### Routing Loss (Target Cost Loss)

```python
class RoutingLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, target_exit_layer: float = 6.0, num_layers: int = 12):
        super().__init__()
        self.target_exit_layer = target_exit_layer
        self.num_layers = num_layers
    
    def forward(self, p_exit_list):
        # Compute expected exit layer
        expected_exit_layer = self._compute_expected_exit_layer(p_exit_list)
        
        # Target cost loss: encourage expected exit layer to be close to target
        routing_loss = F.mse_loss(expected_exit_layer, self.target_exit_layer)
        return routing_loss
```

## 📊 Loss Components

### 1. **Task Loss** (`L_pred`)

- Computed for all BitLinear and H-BitLinear layers
- Formula: `||W - W̃||²` where `W` is original and `W̃` is quantized

### 3. **Routing Loss** (`L_route`)
- Target cost loss encouraging efficient early exit
- Encourages expected exit layer to be close to target
- Formula: `MSE(expected_exit_layer, target_exit_layer)`

### 4. **Early Exit Loss** (where applicable)
- Additional supervision for early exit mechanisms
- Layer-wise weighted loss computation

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Quantization Process

1. **Weight Quantization**: Ternary quantization (-1, 0, 1) with scaling
2. **Activation Quantization**: Multi-bit quantization with per-token scaling
3. **Straight-Through Estimator**: Differentiable quantization during training

### Routing Decision Process

1. **Training**: Straight-through estimator for differentiable sampling
2. **Inference**: Threshold-based decision (`p_exit > 0.5`)
3. **Expected Exit Layer**: `Σ(l * p_exit_at_l)` where `p_exit_at_l = p_exit_l * ∏(1 - p_exit_i)`

### Memory Optimization

- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduces memory usage during training
- **Efficient Quantization**: Reduces model size and memory footprint
- **Early Exit**: Reduces computational cost for easier examples

## 📈 Expected Benefits

1. **Computational Efficiency**: Learnable early exit reduces average computation
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Quantization reduces model size and memory usage
3. **Performance**: Joint optimization maintains task performance while improving efficiency
4. **Flexibility**: Configurable target exit layer and loss weights

## 🐛 Recent Fixes
